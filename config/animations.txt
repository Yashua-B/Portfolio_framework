# Animation Configuration File
# Format: page_number, centerX%, centerY%, size%, icon_filename, duration_ms, delay_ms, trigger_type
#
# Parameters:
# - page_number: Which page (starts at 1)
# - centerX%: Horizontal center point (percentage, 0-100, where 50 = middle)
# - centerY%: Vertical center point (percentage, 0-100, where 50 = middle)
# - size%: Width as percentage of container (any positive number, e.g., 30, 100, 150)
#   * Height is calculated automatically from the SVG's aspect ratio
#   * Values > 100% are allowed for oversized animations (will be clipped at page edges)
# - icon_filename: Name of SVG file in assets/icons/ folder (e.g., "mouse.svg")
# - duration_ms: How long animation stays visible before auto-hiding (milliseconds)
# - delay_ms: Delay before animation appears (optional, default 0)
# - trigger_type: When animation should start (optional, default "visible")
#   * "hover" = Animation triggers when mouse hovers over the page (desktop only)
#   * "visible" = Animation triggers when page becomes visible in viewport (default)
#
# Note: All position and size values use percentages to ensure consistent scaling across screen sizes
# Note: Height is automatically calculated from the SVG's viewBox aspect ratio
# Note: If trigger_type is not specified, defaults to "visible" for backwards compatibility
# Note: Animations with size > 100% will be clipped at the page edges due to parent container's overflow: hidden
#       This is expected behavior - the animation extends beyond the page boundaries and gets clipped
#
# Example: 2, 50, 50, 30, mouse.svg, 60000, 1000, visible
#   - Page 2, centered at (50%, 50%), size 30% width, height calculated automatically
#   - Size can be > 100% (e.g., 150, 200) for oversized animations that extend beyond page edges

# Page 2: Mouse animation, centered position
2, 50, 50, 110, mouse.svg, 200000, 1000, visible
